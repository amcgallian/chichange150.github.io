    <h1>About ChiChange150</h1>
    
    <div class="methodology-card">
      <p><strong>ChiChange150</strong> is an interactive platform that visualizes 150 years of ecological and physical transformation in Chicago. By integrating historical cartography, satellite remote sensing, and environmental datasets, this project documents how a major American city has reshaped its landscape over time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Chicago's physical environment has undergone significant transformations since the 1870s, including the reversal of the Chicago River, expansion and erosion of the Lake Michigan shoreline, changes in vegetation and urban canopy, and the implementation of green infrastructure. While these changes are documented in various archives and datasets, they have not previously been synthesized into a unified, accessible platform.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Combine diverse datasets—historical maps, satellite imagery, weather records, biodiversity observations, and water quality measurements—into a single framework</li>
      <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Create intuitive, interactive tools for exploring environmental change across space and time</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Make complex geospatial data available to researchers, educators, students, and the public</li>
      <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Document methodologies and provide downloadable data for further analysis</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <div class="methodology-card" style="background: #e8f4fd;">
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-style: italic; margin: 0;">How have Chicago's physical and ecological environments changed over the past 150 years, and what spatial and temporal patterns emerge when synthesizing historical and contemporary datasets?</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p>The project draws from the following sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>City Boundaries (1870-2020):</strong> Historical maps from the Mapping Chicago project and Allmaps.xyz; modern boundaries from the City of Chicago Data Portal</li>
      <li><strong>Land Surface Temperature & Vegetation:</strong> Landsat 1-9 imagery (70+ GB, 700+ scenes) processed to calculate NDVI and LST</li>
      <li><strong>Historical Weather:</strong> GHCNd station data from Chicago-area weather stations (1870-present)</li>
      <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> GBIF occurrence data filtered to Chicago boundaries</li>
      <li><strong>Water Quality:</strong> Metropolitan Water Reclamation District monitoring data</li>
      <li><strong>Shoreline & Hydrography:</strong> Digitized from historical maps and aerial imagery</li>
    </ul>
